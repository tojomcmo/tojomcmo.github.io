## Welded TV table

I built this table for my parents to use in their newly renovated house. It works perfectly as a working surface or food surface for a couch meal. The frame is low-carbon steel and the table top is walnut.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/furniture/img_3255.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/furniture/img_3266.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I CADed the frame up with weldments in SolidWorks to generate a cutlist. Getting the right table height with adequate foot adjustment space took some testing and iteration on relevant couches and sitting surfaces.

The frame is TIG welded, super forgiving material so my amature welding skills were covered up nicely. I tacked the frame into shape, slightly angled wide at the front of the table so the burn in would curl the table more into true.
