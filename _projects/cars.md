Much of my professional life post-school I've spent working on automotive systems at <a href="https://indigotech.com/">Indigo Technologies</a>. I started as a Mechanical engineer working on chassis mounting structures. From there my role migrated through the automotive design space, from prototype development of active leaning systems for narrow body vehicles to focusing on suspension systems and active suspension mechanism design.

After short stint in gradschool focusing on dynamics and control, I returned to the company in a broader systems and controls role. I functioned as a thread of continuity between controls development and mechanical development, Eventually my role there morphed into a brief stay as interrum director of controls, working on active suspension and vehicle dynamic control systems. I spearheaded development on core mechancial architecture and control integration for the in-wheel drive and active suspension motor integral to Indigo's vehicle concepts.

Here are videos that show more of the in-wheel drive and active suspension in use.
