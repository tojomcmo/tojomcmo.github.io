I went to the King Richard's Faire this year with a bunch of friends, and i threw together a quick outfit: sort of elven, kinda woodsy.
Friends said "you should just do this for Halloween!" Which is what I did. The outfit needed a bow, and I thought it would be a
fun reason to try making a bow for the first time. I took a week and a half to quickly build a 40 lb pull read oak 64" longbow, loosely
following <a href="https://youtu.be/iVCMsbF_OD0?si=KcVMqiEr4dpgeAlY">this build process</a>. Here are a bunch of pictures outlining the build process,
I'll add more description and information soon. The process was pretty fun, I'm excited to make another one!
