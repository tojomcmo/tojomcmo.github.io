I joined an expedition led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileydrake/">Riley Drake</a> to Prince of Wales Island off the coast of Southern Alaska to study microbiomes in caves. I am not a caver, nor am I a microbiologist, but I have spent a fair amount of time in the Alaskan environment and bring a lot of skills in technical builds in remote areas (see [ROVs](/projects/rovs/), [teaching](/projects/teaching/), etc.). What a better way to spend a vacation!

The team based operations out of a cabin on <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wCeH6JRrJ17kCh1n6"> Red Lake</a>, up on the very northern part of Prince of Wales island. The cabin was hard to find, but ended up being a beautiful and well maintained spot. The trek to and from the cabin included a ~1.5 mile boatride along the lake and a hike out to the road.

One of the main contributions I brought to the party was a water retrieval system to pump water from a nearby stream to the cabin, and a portable propane camp shower. Both systems operated with diaphragm pumps, and were designed to be easily hiked in and out.
